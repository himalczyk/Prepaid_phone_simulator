# Prepaid_phone_simulator

This is a packaged small app.

To make this quickly installable I made it a package :)

You can just install it using:

```
python -m pip install git+https://git@github.com/himalczyk/Prepaid_phone_simulator.git
```

Once dependencies are installed, just use this command being in the root directory to run the app:

```
python -m run.py
```

Have fun with using an some time ago, normal way of calling.

- Twilio
- Twilio: SendGrid
